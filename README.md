hanuman
=======

homegrown lightweight mvc framework

with modern web applications and rapid prototyping in mind, hanuman framework is a toolset based on and featuring:

* PHP based mvc framework (homegrown)
* CouchDB as a flexible store for domain models and schemas (http://couchdb.apache.org/)
* Mustache Tempatling (https://github.com/bobthecow/mustache.php)
* AngularJS for frontend awesomeness (http://angularjs.org/)

those tools as a basis allowed for some powerful features:

* sort of ruby styled routing including routes based on http methods and permissions 
* oauth based authorization with support for third party services

last but not least, hanuman features a highly flexible dynamic domain model editor based on simple json schemas. 
in combination with the permission system this is used to create interfaces for both your front- and backend. it's sort of awesome.
